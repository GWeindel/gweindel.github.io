As in any article, some choices had to be made and what I am presenting in this post was not the focus of the article (plus the analysis was unplanned and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt), but I still wanted to share this result as I find it extremely interesting.\nIn the study reported in the preprint, using experimental manipulations and an electrophysiological measure of response execution, we evaluated the ability of a decision-making model to account for latent cognitive processes in a perceptual decision task.\nIn this task we manipulated the amount of force to produce a response, speed accuracy trade-off instructions and finally stimulus contrast. This last manipulation had an interesting property that revealed a surprising pattern ! But let’s first review the task of the participants and some of the results from the study.\nThe task Participants had to indicate which of two sinusoidal gratings, left and right of a fixation cross, had the most contrast in it with the corresponding button press (hint : it’s on the left on the next image):\nNow the contrast manipulation consisted in increasing the overall contrast of both stimuli while maintaining their difference constant :\nHigher contrast, as on the right of the previous image, yields faster brain response even in the earliest visual sensory systems compared to dimmer stimuli. The nice thing about that manipulation is that, according to the law of Weber-Fechner, the difficulty in comparing the gratings increases with the increase in brightness. This can be seen on the behavioral performance, participants proportion of errors and Reaction Times ($RT$) increase when contrast increases (see the preprint for details of the figure) :\nHence we have here a manipulation where you expect that the time for visual encoding of the stimulus evolves inversly to the time you need to decide. The overall measure of RT cannot show you both effects as they are weighting each other out. Ideally we would like to have a cognitive model of behavior accounting for both dimensions of decision and encoding times but that seems like a hard test for a model.\nIn our paper we tested amongst others, whether the well-known Drift Diffusion Model (as implemented by Ratcliff, \u0026amp; Tuerlinckx, 2002) captures simultaneously the decision and visual encoding properties of this manipulation.\nInitial results The increase in decision time is obviously captured by the model given the high impact of the increase in contrast on both participants accuracy and $RT$s. More interesting is the fact that the model is also able to capture the decrease in the parameter assumed to relate to visual encoding of the stimulus with the increase in contrast. Let’s illustrate it with the actual data from the preprint :\n# I provide the code for each figure just for those who could be interested but you can skip these cells and just look at the outputs # Following loads the packages and the data from the github of the preprint import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd import arviz as az plt.style.use(\u0026#39;seaborn-ticks\u0026#39;)#Plotting theme PMTstats = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;https://github.com/GWeindel/The-Decisive-Role-of-Non-Decision-Time/raw/main/DDM/PMT_M13_stats.csv\u0026#39;, index_col=0)## Recovering DDM estimates from fit PMTtraces = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;https://github.com/GWeindel/The-Decisive-Role-of-Non-Decision-Time/raw/main/DDM/PMT_M13_traces.csv\u0026#39;, index_col=0)## See the preprint for the details The following figure illustrates this observation, the parameter for encoding time ($T_{e}$ y-axis) is indeed decreasing with contrast increase (x-axis).\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,4), dpi=150)#Graphical parameters m = PMTstats[PMTstats.index.str.contains(\u0026#34;t\\(low.Speed\u0026#34;)][\u0026#34;mean\u0026#34;]#Taking a subset (the best) of the estimates from the preprints # Plotting these points plt.errorbar(np.linspace(23,93,6), m*1000, ls=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, marker=\u0026#34;o\u0026#34;, c=\u0026#34;indianred\u0026#34;) # Other graphical parameters plt.ylabel(r\u0026#39;$T_{e}$ Encoding Time parameter (ms)\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Contrast (%)\u0026#39;); Great news, a model like the drift diffusion model, using only RTs and choices, is able to show that visual encoding time is decreasing even though difficulty is increasing the $RT$s (although that is only true under some conditions and there is some uncertainty associated but see the preprint).\nA surprising link Now one thing is particularly interesting. I started to talk with scientists with more expertise in visual processing about the experiment. At that occasion I was redirected to an article written in 2012 by Reynaud, Masson and Chavane (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1618-12.2012). In their article the authors analyze, using voltage-sensitive dye, the temporal dynamics of visual neuron in the primary visual cortex, V1, of two monkeys (Macaca mulata) in …","date":1641392700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641392700,"objectID":"ce032885b7be41b4b4329fde777f3dda","permalink":"https://gweindel.github.io/post/a_surprising_link/","publishdate":"2022-01-05T14:25:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/a_surprising_link/","section":"post","summary":"This post describes a surprising result in the preprint \"The Decisive Role of Non-Decision Time for Interpreting the Parameters of Decision Making Models\" (https://psyarxiv.com/gewb3/)","tags":["modeling"],"title":"A surprising link between electrophysiological data in monkeys and a behavioral model in humans","type":"post"},{"authors":["Gabriel Weindel"],"categories":["post"],"content":"Introduction\nThis is a series of lectures I gave to doctoral students in psychology and neuroscience at Aix-Marseille Université in April 2021. The course aimed at giving enough information and examples about mixed models to allow students to think about how they can apply such models to their data.\nAll the course is intended to be “hands-on” and therefore the R code is provided with reproducible examples (mainly simulations). The code is meant to be accessible to beginners so it remains simple and redundant (and… I’m a python user so I don’t get all the tidyverse things for now).\nAll the content of the slides can be recreated as an interactive jupyter notebook where you can easily live code inside the presentation thanks to the RISE python package. If you’re interested in replicating this lecture take a look at the root repository (https://github.com/GWeindel/lecture_mixed_models_AMU_2021) with all the instructions.\nContent of the course :\nModule 1 The first module is dedicated to linear models both as a reminder and to extend students knowledge on what can be done using linear models (prediction, factor recoding, etc.)\nThe presentation can be found here (best to open in a separate tab and to navigate across slides with the space bar)\nModule 2 The second module introduces the core aspect of linear mixed models in a frequentist context and using the ‘‘’lme4’’’ R package. We start by illustrating the concept of maximum likelihood, hierarchies in the data and how to account for these hierarchies.\nThe presentation can be found here\nModule 3 The last module introduces Bayesian estimation and generalized linear mixed models. The aim is to give students clues to understand these models fitted in a Bayesian context rather than being exhaustive, I conclude with a series of resources for those who want to go further in the learning of regression models and Bayesian estimation.\nThe presentation can be found here\n","date":1620055620,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620055620,"objectID":"bff71c16795c3294c800939bbda9bc1e","permalink":"https://gweindel.github.io/post/lectures_mixedmodels/","publishdate":"2021-05-03T15:27:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/lectures_mixedmodels/","section":"post","summary":"This is a series of lectures I gave to doctoral students in psychology and neuroscience at Aix-Marseille Université in April 2021.
