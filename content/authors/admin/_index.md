I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institut de psychologie of Lausanne University. My fundamental research interest is mental chronometry, i.e. the time required for the completion of information processing units in the brain. 
This topic is classically studied by using mathematical models of cognition to infer, from the overt behavior, the optimal or best-fitting theory. 

My Ph.D. in Aix-Marseille university was focused on how faithfully can mathematical models of behavior capture neural dynamics ongoing during decision-making in humans. This work showed that these models do describe accurately actual information processing units in the brain but only in restrained conditions such as speeded simple decisions. 
My current line of research addresses this limitation by augmenting cognitive models with electrophysiological measurements and testing predictions from this joint modelling approach on experimental data.
