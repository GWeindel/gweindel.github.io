# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests is mental chronometry, the time taken by information processing units in our brain. To study these times I rely on cognitive models of behavior that I combine with neural data such as electro-encephalography.

I am a Postdoctoral researcher both at the Bernoulli institute of the University of Groningen and at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Utrecht University.

My Ph.D. focused on how faithfully can mathematical models of behaviour capture neural dynamics ongoing during decision-making in humans. This work showed that these models do describe accurately actual information processing units in the brain but only in restrained conditions such as speeded simple decisions. 

My current line of research adresses this limitation in two separate positions, one at the Bernoulli Institute of Groningen University (a funding from the United State Air Force granted to Jelmer Borst and Leendert van Maanen) and another at the Department of experimental psychology of Utrecht University (funded by the European commission under the Marie Slodowska Curie Postdoctoral fellowship). The work in Groningen is centered around the use of mathematical models of cognition and machine learning on neural data to describe how humans make sequential decisions. The work at Utrecht University is about how even in the case of simple decisions, humans rely on several strategies, and therefore, several generative models of behavior.
